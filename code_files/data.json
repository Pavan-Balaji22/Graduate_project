On no-cost extension through 09\/30\/2011 \nSummary of Research Interests: \nMy research program currently focuses on several areas of cell biology in higher plants. \nPeroxisomes are small organelles present in all eukaryotes.  We use a combination of techniques \nto investigate the mechanisms of protein transport into peroxisomes.  In addition to being an \nintrinsically interesting basic biological problem, an understanding of protein trafficking in cells \nis critical as we design strategies to genetically engineer crop plants.  Another project in the lab \nis the study of study of peroxisomal protein networks, using bioinformatics and proteomics to \nidentify and analyze the function of peroxisomal proteins.  In collaboration with Drs. Jianping \nHu (from Michigan State University), we are developing a comprehensive model for plant \nperoxisome function. More recently, we have begun to investigate the process of autophagy in \nplants.  Little is known about the molecular and biochemical components involved in plant cell \nresponses to abiotic stresses that induce autophagy in yeast or mammalian cells.  Homologs to \nmany autophagy genes exist in the model plant Arabidopsis, but their role in plant autophagy has \nnot been established.  Thus, we have begun to examine the induction and functional expression \nof these proteins in response to environmental stresses. \nTeaching:                  Enrollment    Responsibility \nBiol 150 Introductory Biology Workshop  \nF\u201996 \n20     \n100% \nBiol 152 Introductory Biology (for majors) \nF\u201995, \u201897, \u201898  \n500-700        50%  \nBiol 162  Introductory Biology (Honors lab and discussion)  W\u201900 \n24               \n100% \nBiol 162 Introductory Biology (for majors) \nW\u201902,\u201903,\u201904,  \n500-850          50%     \u201905,\u201906,\u201807 \nBiol 172  Introductory Biology (for majors) \nW\u201909,\u201910, \u201811  \n550-625  50% \nBiol 200  Undergraduate Tutorial \nF\u201997-present   \n1-5 \n100% \nBiol 300\/MCDB 300  Undergraduate Research \nF\u201994-present  \n1-20 \n100% \nBiol 302\/MCDB 302 Teaching Experience for Undergraduates \nF\u201901, F\u201904, W\u201910 \nMCDB 397\/EEB 397  Writing in Biology \nF\u201909, \u201810 \n24 \n100%  \nBiol 400\/MCDB 400 Advanced Undergraduate Research F\u201995-present 1-15 \n100% \nMCDB 401 Science Writing  \nF\u201908 \n20 \n100% \nMCDB 412 Teaching Biology \nW\u201911   4 \n100% \nUC 415 Research Methods in the Natural Sciences F\u201911 \n25 \n100% \n(Responsible Conduct of Research for undergrads) \nBiol 428 Cell Biology \nW\u201995, \u201896, \u201897, \u201998 \n130-160     50-100%  \nBiol 428 Cell Biology \nF\u201999, \u201900 \n50-70         50% \nPIBS 503 Bioethics modules for grad students \nF\u201909, \u201810 \nvaries  \nvaries \nBiol 515 Molecular Biology of Plants \nF\u201994 \n15  50% \nBiol 601 Investigations in Biology \u2013 CPR  \nF\u201901 \n100% \nBiol 700\/MCDB 700 Graduate Student Research (First-year) \nW\u201994-present  \nMCDB 614 Model Organisms and Approaches \nF\u201906 \n15  15%  \nBiol 800\/MCDB 800 Plant Cell and Molecular \nF\u201993,\u201894,\u201896,\u201897,\u201901,\u201902,\u201906,\u201907;     100% \nBiology Journal Club  \nW\u201994,\u201895,\u201900,\u201802 \n10-15  \n100%  \nMCDB 800 Preparing Future Faculty Seminar \nW\u201906,\u201907,\u201908,\u201809 \n50-85           25-33% \nMCDB 800 Mentoring Research Undergraduates \nF\u201906, F\u201907 \n15 \n100% \nMCDB 800 MCDB Departmental Seminar  \nF\u201909, \u201810 \nBiol 990 Graduate Student Research \nF\u201995-present  \nBiol 995 Advanced Graduate Student Research \nW\u201997-present                                        Laura J.

Reviewing\/editorship activities.  The PI currently reviews for The Journal of Chemical Physics, The \nJournal of Physical Chemistry, The Journal of the American Chemical Society, Journal of Organic \nChemistry, and Nature Communications. \n4. Teaching:  The PI has developed a graduate course on time-dependent spectroscopy which serves to: \n(1) teach graduate students and advanced undergraduates a modern perspective on spectroscopy, thus \nallowing them to understand non-linear and coherent methods; (2) introduce students with varied \nresearch interests to spectroscopic methods now commonly used to interrogate chemical systems and \nmaterials, and (3) provide students joining the PI\u2019s research laboratory with a background knowledge \nof time-dependent spectroscopy.  This course is appropriate for students who have taken a junior-\nlevel physical chemistry course.  The lecture notes developed for this class fill the void between \nconventional and advanced spectroscopy texts. \n5. Outreach activities:  The PI and his graduate students have developed educational outreach activities \nthat center on rudimentary concepts in spectroscopy \u2013 including demonstrations and activities \nillustrating basic principles of light (diffraction), as well as the relationship between light \nabsorption\/emission, color, and molecular and atomic properties.  Outreach relationships have been \nestablished through the JHU School of Education and Center for Educational Outreach, and the PI\u2019s \nlab routinely hosts outreach events and lab tours for local K-12 science teachers and AP Chemistry \nclasses.  A key component of the group\u2019s outreach has involved developing\/adapting inexpensive Curriculum Vitae:    Arthur E.

Research Interests: development of cancer chemopreventive\/chemotherapeutic agents \nMy medicinal chemistry research program involves the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of \nmolecules that could potentially delay, inhibit, or cease carcinogenesis. I am particularly interested in \nexperimental drugs with the ability to block the transcriptional activity of the oncogenic protein FOXM1: \nForkhead box M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor modulators. \nFOXM1 is a transcription factor involved in cell replication; it is of the \u201cmaster\u201d regulators of cell cycle \nprogression, particularly in the G1\/S, and G2-M phase. FOXM1 is essential to couple DNA replication, cycle \ncontrol, and mitosis. However, it has been implicated in promoting multiple steps of cancer progression, \nincluding the induction of mitogenic and survival signals, as well as the induction of tumor invasion, migration, \nand angiogenesis. Consequently, FOXM1 has been regarded as a reliable marker for early cancer detection \nand a promising target for arresting cancer growth and progression, which are ideal characteristics of an \neffective chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic drug. \nXIV.

conference, Calgary, Ab., June 2000 \nResearch Interests \nN-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-stabilized clusters.  \nIn papers 114 and 115 (Nature Chemistry 2019 and Jacs 2019), \nwe describe the first examples of metallic nanoclusters protected by \nNHC ligands. Nanoclusters are a unique class of nanomaterial in that \nthey are materials with size-dependent properties, but unlike related \nnanoparticles, they are atomically precise single molecules, while \nnanoparticles are conglomerates of similar-sized species. Nanoclusters \nare typically prepared with thiol ligands as surface ligands, with some Cathleen M Crudden, CV Attachment \nexamples of phosphines. Neither of these ligands is perfect: thiol-based ligands exclusively \nprotect clusters by surrounding them with a shell of oxidized Au species, and phosphines are \nweakly bound, limiting the stability of the resulting nanoclusters. NHCs are the best of both \nworlds, they keep the Au core in a metallic state, but bind with very strong bonds. These clusters \nhave unique properties including the highest photoluminescence quantum yield ever recorded \nfor nanoclusters.  \nSelf-assembled NHC monolayers on gold.  \nIn paper 79, (Nature Chemistry 2014), we described the first \nexample of well-formed carbon-based monolayers on gold surfaces. \nDespite their widespread use in catalysis, N-heterocyclic carbenes \n(NHCs) have seen few applications in materials chemistry. In molecular \ntransition metal complexes, they are known by their abilities to form \nstrong metal\u2013carbon bonds, making NHC complexes more resistant to \nheat and oxidation than typical complexes. With the assumption that \nthese properties would translate to materials, we attempted the \nsynthesis of self-assembled monolayers on gold and found that \nsterically unencumbered carbenes form monolayers that are \nsignificantly more stable than the state-of-the-art sulfur-based films.  \nThe NHC films are stable to high temperature, refluxing solvent, boiling \nacid, base and oxidation with dilute hydrogen peroxide.  The work was called \"game changing\" \nand \"the new gold standard\" by international experts, and highlighted in chemistry and physics \nnews magazines including Chemical and Engineering News (US), Physics Today (UK), \nChemistry World (UK), Canadian Chemical News (CDN) and others.  \nBench-stable precursors for self-assembled monolayer formation. \nIn publication 94, (Nature Communications 2016), the synthesis of a single component \nbench-stable precursor for use in the preparation of NHC films on metals was described. While \nour \nprevious \npublication \nrequired \ninert \natmosphere techniques and highly reactive \nchemicals, with this precursor, it is possible to \nprepare high quality films in air, without any \nspecial \nprecautions. \nFilms \ncan \nalso \nbe \ndeposited in vacuo without any solvents. With \nthese \neasily \nformed \nfilms, \nwe \nalso \ndemonstrated the formation of biosensors that were significantly more robust, reliable and \nsensitive than commercial biosensors.  \nStereoretentive Suzuki-Miyaura cross couplings.  \nOur \ngroup \nhas \nreported \na \nsubstantial \ndevelopment in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction (Jacs \n2009 and 2014, and ACIE 2014). This reaction is the \nnumber one reaction used in industry for the \npreparation of carbon-carbon bonds. Prior to our \nreports, the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction could only be \nused to make bonds with no stereochemistry, which is Cathleen M Crudden, CV Attachment \na huge limitation since a significant number of pharmaceutical compounds are chiral. We have \nreported the first example of this reaction performed with chiral organoboron partners, \nproceeding with retention of chirality. Prior to this report, all coupling reactions of these systems \nfailed or proceeded with loss of stereochemistry\/chirality. The work has been used by other \nlabs in the synthesis of two pharmaceutical agents, and has been highlighted in Chemical and \nEngineering News, and Synfacts, among others.   \nIterative Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling of multiply borylated molecules.  \nIn our second 2016 Nature Communications paper (#89), \nwe reported the first example of iterative reaction of multiply \nfunctionalized organoboron compounds without any protecting \ngroup requirements. In addition, chiral compounds could be \nemployed without loss of chirality. This discovery is currently under \nuse in the automated robotic synthesis of organic molecules. This \ntype of synthesis is employed in many other fields such as for the \nsynthesis of genes and peptides, but has not been employed in \nthe synthesis of small molecules in collaboration with the Burke \ngroup at UIUC.  \nMajor Grants and Awards in Support of Research \n2019 \nIdea to Innovation (NSERC) \n$125,000 \n2019 \nInnovation for Defense Excellence and Security (Public Works)  \n$160,000 \n2018-2020 \nPetroleum Research Fund \n$120,000 \n2017-2020 \nJapan Society for Promotion of Science (operating funds)  \n$225,000 \n2016\u20132020 \nNSERC Discovery Grant (operating) \n$625,000                                 (highest nationally in 2016) \n2015 \nCFI Innovation Fund\/MRI-ORF (Crudden (PI) with 9 others) \n$8,823,520 \n2015\u20132016 \nKillam Research Fellowship \n$140,000 \n2014-2016 \nJapan Society for Promotion of Science  \n$180,000 \nKakenhi (Grants-in-aid for Scientific Research) operating funds \n2014-2016 \nNSERC strategic grant, Crudden, (P.I.), Kraatz, Kennepohl, \nHorton, J.H. and Albrecht, M.

The \ufb01rst work product of this endeavor is the\nworld\u2019s \ufb01rst self-driving laboratory for thin \ufb01lms discovery (Science Advances, 2020). Motivated by the fact that\nbillions of dollars of private and public investment have failed to move the needle toward a cleaner energy\neconomy, we are aiming to do science in fundamentally di\ufb00erent ways by increasing the throughput for materials\ndesign and screening by >10-fold.\nAdvanced Solar Cells and Interfacial Electron Transfer: Thin \ufb01lm organic and perovskite solar cells can convert\n20% of incident sunlight into electricity, but they still su\ufb00er from stability and manufacturing issues. This motivated\nour program to develop clear design principles for light-harvesting and conductive layers of organic solar cells\n(Angewandte Chemie Int. Edition, 2018). The structure-property relationships we have developed led us to the\nrecent discovery of the \ufb01rst dopant-free hole-transport material capable of hitting power conversion e\ufb03ciencies of\n>20% in a perovskite solar cell (Energy & Envir. Sci., 2019). Additionally, our group has pioneered the development\nof high performance cyclometalated ruthenium dyes in the dye-sensitized solar cell (Inorg. Chem., 2009; J. Am.\nPage 2 of 4Curriculum Vitae\nCurtis P. Berlinguette\nChem. Soc., 2010). These dyes are characterized by tunable excited- and ground-state reduction potentials\n(Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2011). These dyes have provided a powerful platform for studying interfacial photophysical\nand photochemical processes at an unprecedented, atomic-orbital level of resolution (Nature Commun., 2017).\nEnergy Storage and CO2 Utilization: The e\ufb03cient conversion of sunlight into electricity is not the complete answer\nto the impending energy crisis - we need to be able to store and transport energy and mitigate the negative\nenvironmental impact of current energy production methods. Our group is interested in two processes that address\nthese challenges: solar-driven water electrolysis to produce clean hydrogen fuel, and the electrolytic conversion of\nwaste CO2 into carbon-based fuels and chemicals. The mechanistic insights we gain on water splitting and CO2\nreduction are combined with our engineering expertise in pursuit of e\ufb03cient, selective, stable electrolyzers that can\nbe commercially deployed to disrupt the economics of clean energy technologies.\nLow-Temperature Nuclear Fusion: My research group has played a leading role in a multi-disciplinary e\ufb00ort\nsponsored by Google seeking the conditions necessary to drive fusion reactions at lower temperatures (Nature,\n2019). Our contributions to this e\ufb00ort provided unprecedented insight into how hydrogen enters and exits\npalladium nanoparticulate \ufb01lms (Nature Materials, 2019), and we have exploited these features to electrolytically\ndrive hydrogenation chemistry using palladium \ufb01lms\/membranes (Nature Catalysis, 2018; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2019;\nJ. Mater. Chem. A, 2019).\nThin-Film Deposition: One of the de\ufb01ning contributions of our group is our \u201cphotodeposition\u201d method for making\nconformal, defect-free metal oxide \ufb01lms (Science, 2013; Science Advances, 2015). We used this technique to make\nthe most e\ufb03cient heterogeneous oxygen evolution catalysts known (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2013); indeed, I own the\ncompositional patent to NiFeOx, which is widely studied in the literature. This versatile deposition technique can be\nused to make metal oxides containing almost any metal in the periodic table with acute control of relative metal\ncontent. The applications for the methodologies we have developed extend to consumer electronics and smart\nwindows (Chem, 2018).\nFEATURED PUBLICATIONS\nKellett, C. W.; Kennepohl, P.; Berlinguette, C.

In 2004, as Chair of the CSC Inorganic Division, commissioned the\nInorganic Chemistry Exchange (ICE) program, with the goals of increasing the visibility of inorganic chemistry among\nundergraduates, attracting talented students into graduate research in inorganic chemistry, and reinforcing connections\nbetween inorganic research groups across Canada. ICE gives highly motivated undergraduates the opportunity to\nconduct cutting-edge research at universities across the country, and brings them together to present their results at\nthe end of the summer. Now in its 16th year, ICE has involved nearly 150 undergraduates and over 50 faculty at 23\ninstitutions; many ICE alumni went on to pursue graduate research in chemistry.\n","48":"  \nDr. Fraser Fleming \nFRASER F.

I have also participated in the instruction of Graduate Students, both in the College \nof Medicine and in the Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics in the College of \nAgriculture and Life Sciences. From 1993 through 1996, I taught one portion of the \ufb02agship \ngraduate cell biology course in the College of Medicine. I have also contributed to several \ncourses in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics. From 1995 to 2009, I gave \nseveral lectures in the biophysical chemistry course. I also team taught an undergraduate \nhonors Biochemistry course for sophomore biochemistry majors. Since 2010, I have \nprovided occasional lectures to the medical students, undergraduate biochemistry students \nand I have also given lectures in other undergraduate and graduate level biochemistry \ncourses.\nTeaching Awards\n1998\u20131999\nCenter for Teaching Excellence Scholar (Texas A&M University)\n2002\u20132003\nTeacher\/Scholar Award from the University Undergraduate Honors \nprogram\nResearch and Graduate Student Supervision\nPostdoctoral or Research Scientists\nGerald Grimsley  Beatrice Huyghues-Despointes  Erode Prabhakaran  Satoshi Iimura\nGraduate Students Thesis\/Dissertation Advisor\nBrian Hubbard  Jeff Myers  Susanna Sroka  Eric M.

Our discovery of new bioactive agents is through the chemical \ndiversification of intermediates within our total synthesis routes of the natural products investigated, \nincluding, but not limited to the balgacyclamide, brocazine, and chalcone families of natural products. This \nstrategy has allowed for the access of unique scaffolds of biological importance. In addition, these new \ndiversified intermediates have been transformed into new chemical libraries that possess tunable and \nselective transformative properties that are being used in the development of new chaperone-like small \nmolecules (CLSMs) to aid in the transport of agents of interest across complex biological barriers. We have \nadvanced projects that employ these CLSM for the delivery of agents, which alone have no penetration \nproperties, into gram-negative bacteria as well as across the blood-brain barrier.  \nPostdoctoral Fellows Supervised \nName      Doctoral Program\/Advisor     Dates Supervised \nCurrent Employer \nDr. Ashabha Lansakara      U. of Iowa\/Prof. Pigge        2016-2017  \nCambridge Isotope Lab \nDr. Thi Nguyen      Kansas State\/Prof. Hua        2014-2015  \nPfizer \nGraduate Students Supervised  \nName\/Current Employer   Undergraduate Institution     Years Supervised \nDegree \nAsantha Fernando      University of Colombo        2018-Present \nPh.D., Expected 2023 \nShashika Perera      Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon       2018-Present \nPh.D., Expected 2023 \nAnthony Fatino       University of Central Missouri       2016-Present \nPh.D., Expected 2021 \nPrathibha Desman      University of Colombo        2015-Present \nPh.D., Expected 2020 \nWasundara Hulangamuwa  University of Colombo        2015-Present \nPh.D., Expected 2020 \nDr. Chamitha Weeramange Witicha State University        2014-2018  \nPh.D., 2018   (PostDoctoral Researcher, Univ.

June 2002-August 2005.  Instructor of CHEM101-63 course.  I taught a \nvigorous first-semester general chemistry course with laboratory in 7 weeks in the \nsummers. I taught both lecture and laboratory. \n10. Curriculum Improvement Proposals\/Funded  \nUTRA, summer 2006, funded a teaching assistant, Ms. Kimberly Martinod (\u201907) $3000. \nKimberly assisted me in revising, updating, and launching Chem 100 web online course \n(originally written by Profs Weber and Rose-Petruck) using a wiki platform linked with \nmycourses. She helped transfer the content from html to wiki, and we  both revised the \ncourse content and edited and\/or modified the assessments in mycourses. I wrote and \nadded a diagnostic or pretest to the course, and I rewrote substantial portions of the \ncourse and assessments. The tasks were aided by assistance from Stewart Mader from \nITG with the use of a wiki.  \nCurricular Development Grant from the Dean of the College, $2500, summer 2007, to \nrun and revise Chem 100 web course in summer 2007 and completely revise all problem \nsets, exams, and workshop problems of Chem 330T, and make course improvements for \n330T and Chem 100.  This grant allowed me to write new problems for workshop of \nChem 330T and examine a number of assisted online homework\/ tutorials, making \npossible introduction of a workshop to Chem 330T and introduction of Mastering \nChemistry online homework and tutorials in the Fall and spring of 2007-2008 to Chem \n100 and Chem 330T to address the challenge of improving problem-solving skills of all \nstudents.  \nCourse proposal for \u2018Chem 33T in January\u2019 program, with Dean David Targan, sent to \nJanuary@Brown committee, October 2007.    The course had 6 registered students in \nJanuary 2008, and it was one of five courses offered in January@Brown 08: Jan 9-18, \n10am-1pm.  In December 2008 the January@Brown 2009 program was cancelled, but I \nran the planned lectures in January 12-17 2009 to any interested available students; one \nstudent attended all lectures, two others came part-time. Since there is no funded housing \nfor students, most students are not able to come in January. \n11.

In catalysis our interest started with a\nstudy in vanadium chemistry by using a ligand system which has received substantial attention in the literature for its role in sustaining\nexceptional catalytic activity with late metals. Besides \ufb01nding another potent catalyst, our paper in vanadium chemistry was the \ufb01rst insight into\nthe direct involvement of the ligand system in the organometallic chemistry of the metal center (J. Am. Chem. Soc.  1999, 121, 9318).  In an\nattempt to generalize these unique \ufb01ndings we have also tested middle metals and found what seemingly is an endless variety of\ntransformations (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002,124,12268). Last but not least we also \ufb01nd that the ability of this ligand to work as electron storage\nallows a curious ambiguity in the metal oxidation state, which positively a\ufb00ects both catalytic performances and molecular activation (J. Am.\nChem. Soc. 2005, 127, 13019). It is just in the last few months that we have made what we are convinced to be a major breakthrough. By\ndesigning a new type of hemilabile catalytic system, we are in the fortunate position of being able of preparing families of single component\ncatalysts of extremely high polymerization activity (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.2007, 46, 6119). Still focusing on processes forming C-C bond from\nethylene, we have started a project aimed at understanding the selective oligomerization. In search for working hypothesis, our research has\ninitially focused on studying established catalytic systems and has yielded important insights into the factors promoting activity and selectivity (J.\nAm. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 9238, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.  2006, 45, 7050, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2008in press).            In a separate line of research we pursue our interest for understanding activation of dinitrogen. Our recent work in f-block elements\nchemistry has provided evidences for the cooperative interaction of one-electron reductants on the same dinitrogen substrate, a feature\nsomehow related to the behavior of the Fe cofactor of nitrogenase. Instead, by using a multi-electron reductant such a uranium and transient\nlow-valent thorium synthons we have obtained the sole existing examples of dinitrogen cleavage and partial hydrogenation promoted by a f-\nblock element (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.  2002, 41, 3433, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003,42, 4958, cited by C&En, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl2003, 42, 814. Cited by C&En).           Very recently we have turned our attention to CO  activation an water splitting (see list of most recent publication below). To this end, we\nhave discovered unprecedented bonding mode of CO  to a metal center (Angewandte Chemie Int Ed Engl. VIP accepted) and linked such a\ncoordination to the enhancement of radical behavior of CO\n(Chem. Eur.J. 2017, 23,17269\u201317278.), extracting H atom from the solvent in an\noverall facile reduction process (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2018, 57, 10928). We also have designed a new system where shuttle chemistry is used to\nperform a two stage water splitting (Dalton 2017,46, 49).\nMost Recent Publications\n262.     Camilo J. Viasus, Nicholas P.

It is a\nchallenge in that many will have no prior experience in or con\ufb01dence with computers, while others consider\nthemselves computer experts. I cover a variety of concepts including algorithms, ethics, networking, and\nHCI. In 2011 I created a custom edition of the textbook with lab experiences designed to complement the\nmaterial, and I have since created several additional lab experiences. 6 o\ufb00erings between 2003 and 2015 for\na total of over 700 students\nCPSC1620\nFundamentals of Programming I\nThis is the \ufb01rst course in programming that all Computer Science majors must take. We introduce C++\nand attempt to cover basic concepts of programming up to pointers in this course. In my 2010 o\ufb00ering I\nintroduced some of the concepts using a learning tool called Scratch, an approach never before used here at\nULeth. 3 o\ufb00erings between 2002 and 2010 for a total of 217 students\nCPSC2610\nIntroduction to Digital Systems\nThis is the \ufb01rst course in hardware, gates, Boolean logic and related topics.\nIn Fall 2008 we added a\nlaboratory component to this course, which uses breadboards and chips to reinforce the material. I was\nsolely responsible for developing the curriculum for these labs. 9 o\ufb00erings between 2005 and 2017; approx.\n180 students.\nCPSC3660\nIntroduction to Database Systems\nThis course consists of the basic introduction to databases, including relational database design, types of\nDBMS, and various tools for working with databases. Typically a project is incorporated into this course. 3\no\ufb00erings between 2003 and 2006; total 127 students.\nCPSC3720\nIntroduction to Software Engineering\nThis course covers aspects of Software Engineering that students should be applying as they move on to\nlarger projects in their careers. For my \ufb01rst o\ufb00ering I redesigned the material to better suit the needs of the\nstudents, and introduced a number of papers from the literature as well as a major project component to\nthe course. I undertook a major redesign to incorporate new curriculum in Spring 2010, and in Spring 2011\nI continued to improve and revise the course with the addition of PSP components and assignments as well\nas an o\ufb00-campus client for the project portion of the course. In 2014 I again revamped the course to focus\non the SCRUM framework for agile software development with a major practical (project-based) portion of\nthe course. 5 o\ufb00erings from 2007 to 2015; total 92 students.\nCPSC4210\/5210\/7210\nIntroduction to Reversible Logic\nThe objective of this course was to provide students with background in the up-and-coming area of reversible\ncomputing.\nTopics included a review of traditional logic synthesis, both combinational and sequential;\nmotivation for reversible logic; technologies; gates and models; synthesis approaches, and current research\non reversible logic synthesis. All graduate students in this course were required to produce a small amount\nof original research in the area. Spring 2013: 19 (7 graduate students, 12 undergraduates)J. E. Rice \u2013 CV\n13\nCPSC4850\/5850\nAdvanced Logic Synthesis Topics\nThis course covered topics such as minimization of Boolean circuits using K-maps, and worked onward\nthrough the area of logic synthesis from there. Topics such as multiple-valued logic and decision diagrams\nwere heavily emphasized. This was a brand-new course for which I designed a coursepack consisting of\nchapter selections and readings which I felt were key. Fall 2004: 21 undergrads, 3 graduate students\nCPSC5850\nResearch Tools and Skills for Graduate Students\nThis course was intended to introduce and train graduate students in the basic skills and tools they will\nneed to be successful in their graduate career. I was asked to develop this course with the intention that it\nbe adopted as a general orientation\/seminar style course required for all graduate students. Spring 2008: 5\nstudents\nWGST3600\nKnowledge, Science and Technology\nThis course covered an investigation of women and the roles they have played in the development of knowl-\nedge, science and technology through-out history. The emphasis was on a feminist point of view. This was\nan entirely new course that had not been (to my knowledge) o\ufb00ered before. All the material was of my\nown design. A revised version was o\ufb00ered (Fall 2013) under the title WGST3060: Gender, Science and\nTechnology.

VanBriesen \nJuly 2020 \nResearch Interests \nMy current research interests are broadly in the areas of (1) urban water system sustainability \nand the built environment water cycle, and (2) the energy-water nexus and watershed decision \nmaking. I\u2019m particularly interested in how natural and engineering water systems interact across \nspace and time and how biogeochemistry alters water quality through these transitions. These \nresearch foci are inter-related and the broad theme of sustainable water could describe my work \nif there was an agreed-upon definition of that!  My prior research included (1) biodegradation of \nrecalcitrant organic compounds (specifically chelates and PCBs) and (2) modeling bacterial \nsystem thermodynamics and diversity.  \nThe thread that runs through all my work is the integration of multiple engineering and natural \nenvironments, or multiple biogeochemical processes, to understand complex systems of \nsystems. Making time-critical engineering and policy decisions and designing regulations based \non simplified representations of complex biogeochemical and engineering systems is fraught \nwith challenges. Solving problems in this domain requires expertise and\/or collaborators in \nchemistry, biology, environmental science and engineering, computer science, statistics, \ndecision science, and policy.    \nVideo Presentations Available: \nVanBriesen Water Research.
